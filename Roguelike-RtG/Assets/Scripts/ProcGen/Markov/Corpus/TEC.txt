again ordered them as they slowly circled the room their stormy grey eyes set on their daughter like a hawk on prey their fingers pensively rested over their lips hiding each of their commands a cleric must never falter they rolled their eyes at their mother their face flushed red from both fatigue and frustration their breathing heavy from the last hard fought rounds how many times have I heard that before they wondered trying to recollect herself and how many more times must I do this today they was exhausted and the room smelled of nothing but sweat even with the windows vented and the many candles lit above them the air felt dense even almost damp so much that anyone who could have entered from the outside would have immediately questioned the intensity of their training they had been going for what seemed like an eternity without rest  the room itself was rather large with tall concrete walls decorated in an endless supply of weapons and shields – all in some form or fashion brandishing the sol family emblem; a red sun with a fiery phoenix emerging from its center a testament to the nation’s perseverance and the ferocity of its many great leaders the clerics above them hung a large fine iron chandelier emanating light to the far corners of the arched ceilings the only entrance and exit to the room were a pair of large wooden doors with carved intricate designs followed by a narrow red carpet that only stretched a few feet in  all conveniently found behind their mother now they however stood center in the room in a decently sized marble circle that for the past few hours had been their only semblance of safety and ironically an endless ring of combat as well in front of they stood three royal guards each fully suited in padded armor and wielding unique wooden weapons two short aiming swords and one lance their armor was scuffed and torn in numerous places from their previous attacks but as beaten as they were they still served as better protection than that of their own light training garments sharp pains pulsed throughout their body from time to time convulsing mainly in their arms and legs a result no doubt from their waning defense and the continuous strain of the day they knew they would be bruised and aching for some time after but their mind had already acclimated to this they had to continue one of the guards perked up standing at a brief attention to speak while raising one hand to their chest in salute them forgive me but maybe we should take a rest lady they here looks very weary terra paused their pacing focusing a surprised gaze on the guard and then giving off a semi devious smirk well they asked what say you are you faltering yet they took a deep breath and a moment to think feigning a fix of their crimson red hair back into a short ponytail their fingers danced with their worn hair tie but still struggled to keep everything back as they tightened the last knot they could feel their hands tremble hopefully it had gone unnoticed it sounds to me like he’s the one that’s tired mother they scoffed brushing a few more strands from their view attempting to appear ever confident if anything we can rest for their sake I need none terra returned their smiling gaze towards the guards  well then you already have my answer again without any further hesitation the guards saluted sharply readied their weapons and began a slow uniformed advance deep down they knew that they wanted this to be over just as much as they did yet here they were once again make this one count my little ember terra joked; their smirk more sinister than before an unusual silence filled the room as they moved closer towards they this was a slightly different approach but it presented their with a few new options they unfortunately couldn’t spend more than a few seconds to consider given the whole situation obviously they had learned that attacking independently wouldn’t bode well during the first few attempts they was making quick work of them applying just enough force to stop their advances without injury however their restraint was not rewarded as they progressed throughout the day they began to use more complex tactics rushing to surround their baiting their and even once a full on surprise charge each round proved an even greater challenge and required a larger effort on their part but while ultimately successful with each they were making sure that they was learning along the way a brutal yet ‘genius’ training method designed by none other than their own mother the former commander of the they royal guard in truth they was slightly surprised at how well they were keeping up with their and how much more intense they were from their usual training subjects the they royal guards weren’t common soldiers or thugs  they all fought differently each of them was handpicked for their battle prowess and assigned very specific roles to protect and guide the clerical family uniquely standing out from each other and the rest of the they army after today’s sessions in addition to a countless number of other lectures from their mother they should have known better what to expect  this isn’t a wall they thought to herself taking the defense it’s too simple with each step forward they took they instinctively took one back trying to buy as much time as they possibly could sadly they knew this also worked to their advantage since they was quickly running out of room their eyes scanned the three and their surroundings praying for a good opening to work with but as long as they continued moving in unison there was none to be found acting now would only lead to a most certain disadvantage and a painful lesson with it this would be so much easier with magic they continued thinking slowly adjusting their stance by raising their practice blade just above their head you are running out of room they attack or yield announced terra unimpressed so far they scanned once more but just as terra began to pace again they thought they caught a glimmer of hope the two outside guards began to take extra steps slowly forming the beginning of an arrowed formation  a wedge  they were trying to corner their and cut off any chance of escape a simple yet annoying tactic alas not at all a problem for their skills they didn’t want to give the tell away so quickly but they couldn’t help but smile wide at their find suddenly they dashed at their opponents with incredible speed landing directly between them the group of guards caught off guard instinctively raised their weapons to block and tried to widen the gap but before they could react they had already struck the one in the center breaking their wedge attempt before it had even taken place they landed a solid swing on the first guard’s torso following through with their strike and then quickly landing another to the back of the neck knocking him down they then quickly swung their feet behind their elegantly gliding towards their next opponent while keeping their weapon readied pointed directly down their line of sight the second guard had already begun to lunge blindly thrusting with the tip of their lance they dodged to the inside elbowing him in the ribs as hard as they could and then laced the spine of their wooden sword between their shoulder blades and then around their neck they reached up to grab what would have been the sharp face of their blade squeezed tight twisted their body and slammed the guard down to the ground using their combined weight against him wanting to keep the momentum going they rolled off the second guard and on towards the third but this time was met with an expecting force they had only swung upwards just in time to counter the third guard was surprisingly stronger than the others this stalemate was not one they could win with their speed or tact alone and with the first two still conscious both their time and options remained limited thinking quickly they extended their left hand and snapped their fingers causing a small flame to flicker in their palm as the last guard’s focus momentarily shifted eyes widening with great concern they could feel pressure briefly leaving their shoulders they spun off the block and swung full force towards their head stopping just before impact the guard froze dropping their sword at their feet as they pressed their own against their cheek  silence once again filled the room and they drew another deep breath before finally relaxing their arms allowing him to move away unscathed images of the fight flashed in their mind as they tried to think back on what they had just done they staggered backward a bit as they fought to catch their breath surely this had been their quickest and most efficient spar of the day of course their would undoubtedly object to the use of magic no matter how slight but they was overall surprised with this performance perhaps that would make up for their unsanctioned improv  reckless they nearly shouted how exactly was that reckless backing yourself into a corner waiting for the last possible moment to act grabbing the blade of your weapon responded terra counting off each offense with their fingers honestly what did you expect your performance reeked of desperation it’s as if you decided to ignore everything that I’ve taught you up to this point but terra stopped their do it again they ordered snapping at their guards to get back in position this time no holding back if they has enough time to flash a fancy spell in your face then you have enough time to strike their down they tensed up feeling a wave of anger build up inside of their they had done so well but was still being punished not only that but the guards were obviously well beyond their limits how could their mother justify punishing them so harshly for something that they was responsible for no absolutely not you’ve always taught me to take advantage of a situation pray tell me what was wrong with that to take advantage and to take control terra quickly corrected not only were you sloppy but you also broke my one and only rule did you think I would reward that sleight of hand simply because you won magic is not a means of control nor is it ever fully under control the price paid does not outweigh its benefit in the heat of battle I wasn’t trying to hide it and it was only a little since when have I ever lacked control over my own spells they argued besides I wouldn’t really consider that a spell more like fire magically erupting from your fingertips terra finished for their raising an eyebrow  the candles above us hold more fire than whatever it was I did terra sighed the size of the spell does not matter your dependency on it does I’ve always told you their voice began to fade away a wave of regret now washed over they as they finally gave in to another of their mother’s famous beatings they went on and on about the dangers of magic and how steel was far more reliable in battle in a sense they was always right in their judgments and they did value their feedback whenever they gave it but this had always felt more like an opinion they just could not see how something so powerful and so effective could be as dangerous as they claimed especially when only used in moderation they had also felt their father was adamant about just the opposite during their few trainings with him in any case they knew they could have dragged on the fight and maybe figured out another way to win it was just a matter of committing the time they valued time that had been counting against their from the very start they read the situation as quickly as they could and a small spell even as a distraction was just the easiest way out they could think of taking the time to think of a better offensive would have meant the same opportunity for their opponents and their defense their father had always said that ‘warriors always fight hard but winners also fight smart’ you think just like him always leaping in  are you even listening terra asked sternly yes mother they replied rolling their eyes again their voice now nearly an annoyed whisper terra let out another heavy sigh you take this lightly now but you have much left to learn had this been a dominion sentinel your little display wouldn’t have even worked they are allies they whispered again defiant as ever they always have been their mercy what of a hound what do you think of them we haven’t had to deal with their kind in years mother it’s not like that’s changing any time soon they said a little louder now gripping their practice sword tightly and I am not training for the great war what are you worried about please terra snorted only a fool sits and stares at the pack of starving wolves chills ran down their spine for some reason the words echoed in their head as they met their mother’s angry stare they wanted to keep justifying herself but found they had no words to say in return to their last statement they knew exactly what was meant and the point had already been made the guard stands relieved terra ordered loudly picking up the sword at their feet tell the commander that I will need five fresh for tomorrow five they clearly holds a grudge should have stayed quiet the guards once again saluted without question and began their hurried exit terra twirled the wooden sword a few times with ease cutting sharply through the air around their as they waited for the room to finally clear their white robe fluttered with each of their motions you are your father’s daughter that much is certain they continued inspecting the wooden sword a bit closer now your affinity was never in question but to focus on only one strength in hopes to cover all weaknesses is a mistake a cleric cannot afford not him and certainly not you your skill with a sword should be just as natural as uttering any spell  they couldn’t help but notice a sudden change in tone they no longer seemed as angry as their eyes had hinted but instead a little concerned they could only assume they was thinking and speaking of their father now do you believe me lacking I believe that if you wish to surpass your father in both skill and leadership then yes perfection should be your goal nothing less will suffice and nothing less will satisfy me their grip tightened even more it started to hurt  so encouraging they grumbled terra then lifted their sword towards they its tip stopping inches from their nose I say things with purpose little ember we train like we do because we need to not because we want to I expect you to follow each of my instructions to the letter for your own good I am not one of your guards no but you are my daughter and the next cleric you would be wise to do so anyway they scoffed they swung their sword knocking their mother’s away from their face and then stormed out of the circle they could understand their reasoning and why the training would be difficult at times but there was a clear difference between teaching and belittling if there was anything they could not stand it was being made lesser than what they knew they was another sinister smile began to form on terra’s face it seems you still have fight in you did I strike a nerve what’s your point they groaned tossing their wooden sword back in one of the nearby racks even at my best I can’t meet your standards isn’t that what you just said not that is not what I said at all but since you’re so sure how about a small wager terra twisted their hair into a tight bun and began slowly rolling up the sleeves of their courtly white robes you and me no limits spells included allow me to show you how to control the flow of battle properly their voice hardened emanating confidence that overshadowed even them at the beginning of the last round  win and be done with me lose and well we go again until you do fair they swallowed hard forgetting about the pool of emotions they was just soaking in they had sparred their mother a few times in the past none a pleasant experience but never had they an advantage like magic against their mother was no cleric but their reputation spoke for itself and now after all was said and done they was asking for their to cut loose just to taunt their perhaps this was a chance to prove herself perhaps it was a trap they wasn’t about to waste an opportunity to find out are you sure mother I could hurt you they said their actions betraying their words they eagerly grabbed a new sword from the rack and snapped another larger flame into existence ignoring the intensified pain in their muscles you can certainly try my little ember terra waved their off dropping into a low offensive stance
